This repository contains the code (in R language) that was used to generate all the analyses presented in the manuscript “Machine learning identifies robust matrisome markers and regulatory mechanisms in cancer” by Anni Kääriäinen, Vilma Pesola, Annalena Dittmann, Juho Kontio, Jarkko Koivunen, Taina Pihlajaniemi and Valerio Izzi.

Necessary data are too big to fit in the repository, but they can be downloaded from Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.4134099)
Raw data are available upon request to the corresponding (last) author.

Code is also available in HTML format at https://rpubs.com/Izzilab/matrisome-landmarks
